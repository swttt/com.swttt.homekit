# Homeykit

With this app you can pair Homey to Homekit and control your devices using Siri.

After installing the app grab your iPhone or iPad.
Got to the Home app on your iOS devices, click the `+` and add new accessory.
Now you should be able to scan the code below, or add it manually.

After Homey has paired with HomeKit all your devices will be added. When you add or remove a device from Homey the same wil happen in HomeKit.

A future release wil support excluding zones or devices from HomeKit.

- Light (with RGB or Temperature)

- Switch
- Motionsensor (with lux and temp)
